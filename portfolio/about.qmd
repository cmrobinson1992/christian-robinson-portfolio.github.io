---

I’m a senior data analyst with experience building analytics platforms, dashboards, and predictive models in regulated environments.

I focus on translating messy, real-world data into tools that stakeholders actually use—without over-engineering.

**Core strengths**
- Product-minded analytics (what decisions does this change?)
- Reproducible reporting (Quarto / pipelines)
- Clear communication (exec-ready summaries + technical depth)
