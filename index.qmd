## What I’m Best At

- **End-to-end data science ownership** — framing ambiguous problems, designing the right analysis or model, and delivering outputs that influence real decisions.
- **Modeling with intent** — selecting methods based on business constraints, data realities, and interpretability needs.
- **Translating complexity for stakeholders** — turning technical results into clear narratives for executives, regulators, and non-technical partners.
- **Production-minded analytics** — building models, forecasts, and dashboards that are reproducible, monitored, and maintainable over time.
- **Knowing when *not* to model** — applying simpler analytical approaches when they are more robust, explainable, or operationally appropriate.
